# sql-adapter-source-generator
Playing with generating adapters for SQL based databases from SQL statements or another table spec.

This project is mostly intented to play around with C# Source generators of various kinds in an attempt to build something interesting and with a degree of complexity.
I am not sure this will ever be something for production but if for nothing else, maybe you can learn Source Generators with me.
